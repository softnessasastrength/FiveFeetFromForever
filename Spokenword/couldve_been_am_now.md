# Could’ve Been / Am Now

**[Performance Notes: Slow. Raw. Each stanza is a confession, not a cry. Let the silences ring.]**

I could’ve been this me the whole time.  
Could’ve cracked open ten years ago.  
Could’ve held hands without fear.  
Could’ve told friends I loved them without checking the room first.

But I didn’t.  
Because fear dressed up like safety.  
Because masking got me applause.  
Because affection felt like risk.  
Because shame was baked into every smile I faked.

I could’ve been soft without apology.  
I could’ve kissed without consequence.  
I could’ve said *I’m scared* without choking.  
I could’ve cried in public and called it protest.

I didn’t.  
But I do now.

Now—  
I show up with messy truth in my teeth.  
I let my softness speak before I do.  
I say I want to be held. And I fucking mean it.  
I kiss my friends on the forehead and dare the world to flinch.

Now—  
I record my breakdowns in Audacity.  
I write my trauma in Markdown.  
I unzip zip files of my soul and push them to GitHub.  
I speak like no one’s watching—and that’s what makes them watch.

Now—  
I don’t want perfect. I want presence.  
I don’t want status. I want stillness.  
I don’t want performance. I want *peace.*

I could’ve been this me the whole time.  
But I wasn’t.  
And I won’t grieve that forever.

Because I *am* this me now.  
And now?  
Now is fucking gorgeous.
