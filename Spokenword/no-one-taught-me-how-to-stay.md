# 🧳 No One Taught Me How to Stay

*spoken word for the love-runners and the trauma-trained escape artists*

---

I’m good at leaving.  
At sensing the shift in tone  
and packing my heart before you even notice I’m gone.

I’ve left people mid-conversation.  
Mid-connection.  
Mid-“maybe this time it’s different.”

---

I don’t ghost because I’m cruel.  
I ghost because I was raised  
in a haunted house  
where doors slammed without warning  
and silence was punishment.

---

No one taught me how to stay.  
They taught me how to run.  
How to scan every room for exits.  
How to love with one foot  
already halfway out the door.

---

I built an entire identity  
around escape.

Until one day—  
someone stayed.  
Someone didn’t flinch  
when I broke in the same places I always do.

---

They looked at the exit wound  
and said,  
“I’ll wait here.  
Take your time.”  
And I didn’t know what to do with that.  
I still don’t.

---

Because no one taught me how to stay.  
But I’m learning.

Slowly.  
Messily.  
But I’m learning.
