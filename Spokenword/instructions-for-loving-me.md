# 🧷 Instructions for Loving Me Without Breaking Me

*spoken word for the fragile-hearted warriors*

---

1. **Say what you mean.**  
   Not everyone had the luxury of learning subtext.  
   If you’re cold, say you’re cold.  
   If you’re hurt, say it without the knife.

2. **Mean what you say.**  
   Don’t offer love if you can’t hold it.  
   Don’t promise forever  
   if you're already looking for the exit.

3. **Do not disappear.**  
   I notice.  
   Every slow fade.  
   Every half-response.  
   Every shifted tone.

4. **If I ask you “are we okay?” — I’m not trying to be annoying.**  
   I’m checking if the ground still exists under my feet.

5. **Don’t call me too much.**  
   I’ve swallowed years to become this loud.  
   I’ve buried oceans to make room for this flood.  
   If I overflow, it’s because I spent too long empty.

6. **When I crack, don’t run.**  
   I don’t need a hero.  
   I need a witness.

7. **If I say “I love you” — believe me.**  
   It took me 50 drafts,  
   two panic attacks,  
   and a therapy session  
   to get those three words out.

---

8. **Don’t try to fix me.**  
   I’m not broken.  
   I’m *brutally assembled.*

---

If you can do that—  
if you can hold me where I *am*  
instead of where I should be—

you won’t just love me.  
You’ll meet me.

And that’s rarer than love.
