# ðŸ›Œ The Case for Affection Without Sex

*because weâ€™ve confused intimacy with transaction for too damn long*

---

They look at me sideways  
when I say I want to cuddle.  
No, not as a warm-up to fuckâ€”  
I mean *just cuddle.*

Hold me like I matter  
even when Iâ€™m not trying to impress you.  
Even when my pants are still on.

---

Affection isnâ€™t a currency.  
Itâ€™s a language.  
One we forgot how to speak  
without making it transactional.

---

I donâ€™t want affection as foreplay.  
I want it as a *foundation.*

I want a friend  
who puts their arm around me  
because I had a rough fucking dayâ€”  
not because we might hook up after.

---

I want to normalize laying in someoneâ€™s lap  
with no explanation needed.  
I want to hear someoneâ€™s heartbeat  
without feeling like I owe them mine.

---

Because when Renn held me,  
when Cass curled around me,  
when I rested my head on Briarâ€™s chestâ€”  
those werenâ€™t preludes.

They were *answers.*

They were proof that my body  
was allowed to rest  
without performing.

---

And now I crave that clarity.  
I want the kind of affection  
that doesnâ€™t barter.  
Doesnâ€™t confuse.

Just *gives.*  
Just *holds.*  
Just *is.*

---

So hereâ€™s my case:  
Affection without sex  
isnâ€™t weird.  
Itâ€™s *holy.*

Itâ€™s the kind of love  
we forgot to name.

And Iâ€™m bringing it the fuck back.
