# 🎭 The Role I Never Auditioned For

*spoken word for the survivor of their own silence*

---

I spent my whole goddamn life  
playing a role  
I never auditioned for.  
Stiff jaw.  
Half smile.  
“Yes, sir.”  
“No, I’m fine.”  
“Of course I can handle it.”

I held back tears  
like they were classified.  
Buried panic  
under politeness.  
Laughed too loud  
so no one could hear me *screaming.*

I wore Normal  
like an ill-fitting costume.  
The seams always ripping  
at the worst times.

They told me I was dramatic  
so I became quieter.  
They told me I was lazy  
so I worked ‘til I bled.  
They told me I was too emotional  
so I went numb.

But the role?  
The role never changed.  
Always support.  
Never the lead.  
Always the shoulder.  
Never the storm.

I watched my own life  
from the back row of the theater.  
Clapping for performances  
I wasn’t allowed to give.

Until one day,  
the curtain fell  
without warning.

And I stood there—  
spotlight on,  
script gone,  
just *me.*

No mask.  
No lines.  
No safety net.

And they panicked.

They called it a breakdown.  
I called it the opening scene  
of the life I was finally ready to live.
