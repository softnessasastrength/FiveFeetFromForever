**BODY:** Iâ€™m fine.  
**SOUL:** I havenâ€™t slept in three days and Iâ€™m one missed text away from unraveling.

**BODY:** No worries at all.  
**SOUL:** That *did* hurt. Iâ€™m just afraid if I say something, youâ€™ll leave.

**BODY:** Take your time.  
**SOUL:** Please don't make me wait forever in silence. I spiral.

**BODY:** LOL  
**SOUL:** I'm crumbling in lowercase.

**BODY:** Iâ€™m used to it.  
**SOUL:** I shouldnâ€™t be. I never shouldâ€™ve had to get used to this.

**BODY:** Just tired, thatâ€™s all.  
**SOUL:** Iâ€™m exhausted from carrying grief that doesnâ€™t have a name.

**BODY:** I donâ€™t really cry.  
**SOUL:** I cried *last night*. I just donâ€™t cry *in front of you*.

**BODY:** Itâ€™s no big deal.  
**SOUL:** It was. It *still* is. But I need to believe itâ€™s not just to get through the day.

**BODY:** I donâ€™t need anything.  
**SOUL:** I need *everything*, but I forgot how to ask.

**BODY:** Iâ€™m just built different.  
**SOUL:** Iâ€™m built bruised. Still standing, but bent in places no one sees.
