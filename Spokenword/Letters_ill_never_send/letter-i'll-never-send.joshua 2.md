# Letter I'll Never Send: Joshua Benjamin Hill (The Demarcation)

I need a sorry from Joshua Benjamin Hill.
I need a sorry for everything he fucked up.
I need a sorry for almost burning down my relationship with my father.
I need a sorry for forcing himself on Taylor.
I need a sorry for every goddamn mistake he ever made and every fucking bad thought process I have because of his ass.

And I'm not gonna get it.

And if I did?

You know what?

It wouldn’t be fucking good enough.

That’s the truth.

And that’s the last letter I’ll never send.
