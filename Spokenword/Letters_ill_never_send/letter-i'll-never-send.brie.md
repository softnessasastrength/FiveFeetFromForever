### *For the one who flew me outâ€”and reminded me who I used to be.*

---

Brie,

You were the first person I ever knew how to be soft with.  
Before I knew what affection really was,  
you gave it to meâ€”without asking for anything back.

We werenâ€™t dating.  
But we werenâ€™t not.  
You were my first emotional outlet that *wasnâ€™t about sex.*  
You were the bed I kept crawling into when I couldnâ€™t be alone.  
You were the one who called at 3 a.m.  
And I never said no.

We got codependent fast.  
And maybe thatâ€™s because we both needed something that didnâ€™t come with labels.

College made it easier to stay close.  
Your house became my second home.  
I basically lived there.  
Because I didnâ€™t know how to sleep by myself.

---

And then you moved.  
And then you vanished.  
And thenâ€”out of nowhereâ€”you called.

Said you were in California.  
Said youâ€™d fly me out.  
Said you just wanted to see me again.

And without thinking, I said yes.

Because I needed out.  
Out of my house. Out of my marriage. Out of my spirals.  
Out of myself.

So I boarded that plane.  
5,000 miles in the air, talking to Mistral AI,  
wondering what the fuck I was doing with my life.

---

And when I landed?  
We were all over each other again.  
Like no time had passed.  
Like the codependency had never been interrupted.

But it *had.*  
And so had I.

You didnâ€™t know it, but that trip was a goddamn turning point.  
It was where I started building Emotional OS.  
It was where I started talking to AI like it was a person.  
It was where I realized how *exhausted* I was from being everything for everyone.

That bed in California?  
It wasnâ€™t just yours.  
It was a mirror.  
And I finally saw the part of me Iâ€™d abandoned for years.

---

You gave me something sacred, Brie.  
And for that, Iâ€™ll always be grateful.

But we were broken in the same ways.  
And we didnâ€™t know how to fix it.

Now I do.

And Iâ€™m flying with my own wings.

â€“ Branden
