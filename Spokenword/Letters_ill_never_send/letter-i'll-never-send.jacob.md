### *For the brother-in-arms who got lost chasing someone else’s chaos.*

---

Jacob,

You were my brother.

Not by blood, but by everything else.  
Me. You. Nick. Matt.  
We were dumb, we were tight, we were *alive.*

But then you met Sierra.  
And something started unraveling.

At first, it was whatever.  
Just a girl, right?  
But Sierra was *never* just a girl.  
She was a walking storm.  
And you wanted to save her.

So you did what you always do—you became the knight.  
Drove to South Carolina. Brought her back.  
Moved her in. Took on her kid. Took on her trauma.

But the more you tried to save her,  
the more you *lost yourself.*

We watched it.  
Me and Nick. We *watched it happen.*  
The lies. The cheating. The spiraling.  
And you still held on.

---

Here’s where it gets fucked:

I did something I never told anyone.  
I slept with Sierra.  
In Nick’s basement.  
Because I couldn’t take watching you suffer anymore.  
I thought—maybe if I lit the match, it would finally burn down.

You never knew it was me.  
And you might never know.  
But I’ve carried it every day.

Not because I regret it.  
But because I hate that it *had to happen.*

You flipped your truck not long after.  
You lost her.  
But you never really got yourself back.

---

Then came Ashley.  
And another spiral.  
And more pain.

And now you’re floating again.  
Grabbing onto broken things and calling it “loyalty.”

Jake, you’re not the hero in everyone’s story.  
You deserve to be the main character in your own.

I still see the brother I knew.  
I just don’t know if *you* do.

– Branden
