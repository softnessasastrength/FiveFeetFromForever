# 🧾 An Open Letter to My Father (Matthew)
### *Half-rage. Half-prayer. All truth.*

---

Dear Matthew,

You never really met me.

You met a scared kid who learned to perform so you'd love him.  
You didn’t ask who I was—you just started molding.  
You tried to make me into a version of me that fit your idea of a son.  
And that version? It hurt to wear. It scraped off pieces of who I really was.

You didn’t teach me how to love myself.  
You taught me how to hide.  
How to push it down. How to swallow it. How to **mask** so well even I forgot who I was.

And yeah—maybe I want to hit you.  
But also? Maybe I want to hug you.  
Because I still want a father.  
Because *somewhere* in all of this rage and shutdown,  
there’s still a little kid hoping you might say:  
> “I see you now.”

But I’m not waiting anymore.

You don’t get to know me just because you’re my father.  
You have to *meet* me. As I am. Not who you imagined.

So here it is:

I’m not broken. I’m not failing.  
I’m not some fucked-up project that never got off the ground.

I’m **Branden**.  
Neuro-spicy. Loud. Emotional. Honest.  
Trying every day.  
And no longer performing for you. Or anyone.

If you want to know me?  
Start by reading this.  
Then sit with it.  
Then ask me who I am—**without trying to change the answer.**

– B
