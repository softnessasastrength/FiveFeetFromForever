### *For the loves I mishandled, and the silence that broke us.*

---

Emily,

You were my first real "maybe."  
We met during SafeGrad. You gave me your number.  
I was too scared to call, so you found me instead.  
You chased me. You believed in me.  
And when I finally gave in to it… my anxiety took the wheel.

I overthought. I spiraled. I questioned everything.  
And then you cheated.  
And that was that.

But even now, I wonder:  
Did I drive you away before you ever left?

Maddie (Madison Smith),

You were the soft landing I wasn’t ready to fall into.  
You were kind, steady, present.  
And I was scared.  
Not of you—but of how *fast* it all started moving.

We went from friends to “something more” in a blink,  
and I couldn’t find the brakes—or the words.  
I didn’t want to hurt you.  
So instead, I let it all fizzle out.  
Silent. Confusing. *Cowardly.*

And I own that now.

I should’ve said:  
“I’m not ready.”  
“I’m not feeling this the way I thought I would.”  
“I care about you—but not in that way.”

But I didn’t.  
And that silence made the ending so much worse than it had to be.

Bree told me it was part of my development.  
That I *needed* to experience you to grow.  
And maybe she’s right.

But Maddie, I’m still sorry.

Not because we didn’t work.  
But because I left you without clarity,  
when I owed you the truth.

---

To both of you—

I’m better now.  
Not perfect.  
But honest.

And if I could rewrite anything,  
it wouldn’t be the endings.

It would be my voice.
