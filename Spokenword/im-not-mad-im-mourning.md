# 🖤 I’m Not Mad, I’m Mourning

*spoken word for the grief no one names*

---

I’m not mad.  
I’m mourning.

There’s a difference.

Anger throws things.  
Mourning holds them and asks,  
“Why did I have to lose this?”

---

I’m mourning the version of me  
that thought love was enough.  
The one who kept giving  
because they didn’t know  
they were allowed to stop.

---

I’m mourning the conversation  
we’ll never have.  
The one where you finally get it.  
Where you look me in the eyes  
and say,  
“I’m sorry. I should’ve stayed.”

---

I’m mourning the time.  
The birthdays.  
The messages I never sent  
because I didn’t want to be too much again.

---

I’m not mad at you.  
I’m mad at the silence.  
At the way it became our only shared language.

---

I’m not mad.  
I’m mourning.

And mourning is quieter.  
But it cuts deeper.

---

You didn’t just leave.  
You became a ghost  
in a room I still have to live in.
