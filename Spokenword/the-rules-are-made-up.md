# 📝 The Rules Are Made Up

*and we’ve been performing someone else’s play for too long*

---

They hand us scripts  
before we even know how to speak.  
How to love.  
How to touch.  
How to feel.

“Only touch if you’re dating.”  
“Only cry if you’re alone.”  
“Only love one person at a time.”  
“Only call it real if there’s sex involved.”

Bullshit.

---

Who wrote these rules?  
Who benefits from them?  
And why the fuck are we still following them  
like they were carved in stone?

---

The truth?  
The rules are made up.

You can love your friend with your whole chest  
and not want to sleep with them.  
You can cuddle a stranger  
and still respect boundaries.

You can cry on someone’s shoulder  
without explaining yourself.  
You can say “I love you”  
and mean it platonically.

---

There’s no referee.  
No Relationship Police.  
No intimacy audit.

Only you,  
your nervous system,  
and the people who hold you like it matters.

---

I’m done playing by fake rules  
written by repressed people  
who couldn’t handle tenderness  
without a transaction.

---

I want chosen family,  
not prescribed roles.  
I want friendships that let me be soft  
without being accused of having motives.

---

Because when the rules are made up—  
so are the limits.

So rip the script.  
Write your own.  
And love how you fucking want to.
