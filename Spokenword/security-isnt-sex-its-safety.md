# 🛏️ Security Isn’t Sex, It’s Safety

*for the ones who didn’t save me with words, but with presence*

---

It wasn’t the sex.  
It was the *safety.*  
The way her presence made my nervous system go quiet  
for the first time in years.

---

Cass didn’t just touch me.  
She *stabilized* me.  
Unconsciously.  
Subconsciously.  
Whatever the word is—  
it doesn’t matter.  
Because what she gave me  
wasn’t planned.

---

She held me when I was crumbling  
and didn’t flinch.  
She laid next to me  
while my thoughts went to war  
and didn’t retreat.

---

And when I started showing her affection—  
not to get something,  
but to give back what she gave without knowing—  
it started stabilizing *her*, too.

---

She asked me why I did it.  
And I said,  
“You saved me first.”

---

The best sleep I’ve ever had  
was wrapped around her.  
Not because of lust.  
Because I knew I wouldn’t be abandoned in the dark.

---

What I crave isn’t sex.  
It’s the *security*  
of someone choosing to stay soft  
while I figure out how to breathe again.

---

That’s what affection gave me.  
Not fireworks—  
but silence.  
Not heat—  
but home.
