# 😵 Too Much and Not Enough

*spoken word for the ones told to shrink and stretch at the same time*

---

I’ve always been too much  
and somehow still not enough.

Too loud.  
Too quiet.  
Too clingy.  
Too cold.

They said “Be yourself.”  
Then punished me for doing it too honestly.

---

I tried to shrink.  
Starved my feelings.  
Caged my thoughts.  
Bit my tongue ‘til it bled.

I tried to stretch.  
Smiled wider.  
Laughed longer.  
Gave more than I had.

And still—  
too much.  
Not enough.

---

I chased approval like it could save me.  
Like maybe if I earned it hard enough,  
they’d let me breathe as I am.

But they never did.

---

So now?

I don’t stretch.  
I don’t shrink.

I *stand.*

Exactly as I am.

And if that’s too much,  
they were never meant to carry me.
