# Rage Against Expectation

**[Performance Notes: Loud. Staccato. Slam style. Channel every time you were told to be smaller.]**

They told me to fit in.  
So I broke the fucking mold.  
They told me to shut up.  
So I screamed my truth till it echoed off algorithms.

They told me to sit still.  
So I danced barefoot in the dirt.  
They told me to man up.  
So I sobbed in public with my arms wide open.

Society said: shrink.  
So I expanded.  
Society said: perform.  
So I bled.

Every expectation handed to me was a fucking muzzle.  
Smile like you’re fine.  
Date who they say.  
Work till you rot.  
Mask your madness in LinkedIn smiles.

I say: FUCK THAT.  
I will be tender and terrifying.  
I will hold hands with boys and kiss girls and cry in the breakroom.  
I will post poetry like war cries.  
I will make nervous systems flinch.

I am not your digestible man.  
I am the glitch in the simulation.  
The unmarketable truth.  
The algorithm’s worst fucking nightmare.

You want digestible?  
Swipe left.  
You want pretty pain?  
Go scroll your trauma porn.  
You want raw?  
Then stay.  
Because I’m bleeding honesty like it’s holy.

This is rage wrapped in softness.  
A lullaby laced with gasoline.  
This is for the boys who were told to be bricks.  
And the girls who became ash.  
And the neuro-spicies who never found a home.

We *are* the home now.  
And the system can’t hold us.  
Because we rage too beautifully.  
We cry too loud.  
We love too fucking hard.

Expectation is a coffin.  
And baby—I just clawed my way out.
