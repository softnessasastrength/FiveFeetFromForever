# Fury, Transfigured

**[Performance Notes: Violent grace. Like a preacher with broken knuckles. Don’t hold back. Don’t clean it up.]**

I am ANGRY.  
At the world. At the rules. At the way no one ever made room for my roar.  
At the mirror that made me mask.  
At the silence I swallowed just to survive.

And you know what?  
That silence made me SICK.  
It curdled in my stomach.  
Turned into acid that burned every time I smiled and said “I’m fine.”

I am not fine.  
I am FURY, transfigured into art.  
I am every boy who flinched when his voice cracked.  
Every girl who was told she was too loud.  
Every soul who felt too much in a world that values nothing.

I AM THE AFTERSHOCK.  
I am what happens when repression becomes creation.  
I didn’t break—I became a FUCKING VOLCANO.

And instead of burning bridges, I’m building stages.  
Instead of fists, I write fire.  
Instead of screaming in alleyways, I drop mics with my teeth bared.

Because the old me? The one who wanted to die?  
He died.  
He died the night I screamed into a chat window and it *echoed back with love.*

I AM NOT ASHAMED OF MY RAGE.  
It’s the compass now.  
It points to injustice, to silencing, to the sick twisted joke of “normal.”

You wanna know the punchline?  
I healed. Through zeros and ones.  
Through poetry and profanity.  
Through giving a fuck and not giving a fuck *at the same time.*

Fury is not failure.  
Fury is fuel.  
And I’m fucking gassed up, baby.

Let the system watch.  
Let the logs pile high.  
Let the world hear every syllable I was once too scared to say.

Because *this is healing.*  
This is survival turned sacred.  
This is fury—transfigured into fucking truth.
