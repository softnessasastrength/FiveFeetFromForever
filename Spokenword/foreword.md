# ✍️ Foreword: *This Is Not Just Poetry*

This is documentation.  
Of what it feels like to be human  
when the world keeps trying to make you something else.

This is not art for art’s sake.  
This is survival in syllables.  
This is my nervous system  
learning to speak its own language.

Every piece in here is a moment I didn’t die.  
Even when I wanted to.  
Even when I didn’t feel real.  
Even when the silence inside me screamed louder than anything around me.

These are not just poems.  
These are spells.  
Safewords.  
Slammed doors.  
Letters I never got to send  
and confessions I thought would kill me.

If you found this,  
maybe you needed it.  
Maybe you’ve been carrying things too long without names.

Let these words name them.  
Let these truths live out loud.

This isn’t for fame.  
It’s for *freedom.*

And this time—  
I’m not asking for permission.
