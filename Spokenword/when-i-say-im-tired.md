# 💤 When I Say I’m Tired

*spoken word for the exhaustion that doesn’t clock out*

---

When I say I’m tired,  
I don’t just mean sleep.  
I mean soul-deep.  
I mean “carrying too many things no one sees.”

---

When I say I’m tired,  
I mean:  
I’ve worn too many masks today.  
Answered “I’m good” too many times.  
Faked too many laughs  
that died on the way out.

---

When I say I’m tired,  
I mean:  
I’m tired of pretending this is normal.  
Tired of biting my tongue.  
Tired of being everyone’s safe place  
and never having one myself.

---

When I say I’m tired,  
I mean:  
I can’t keep being the glue.  
I can’t keep translating my pain  
into something palatable  
for people who wouldn’t stomach it raw.

---

So if I cancel plans,  
don’t ask me what I’ve done today.  
Ask me what I’ve *carried.*

Because I promise you—  
it’s heavy.

And I’m tired.
