# 🎭 Unlearning Love as Performance

*because I thought I had to earn it until I almost died trying*

---

I used to think love had lines.  
Like a script.  
Like if I said the right things,  
acted the right way,  
played the part well enough—  
they’d stay.

---

Love was a performance.  
And I was damn good at it.

Smiling when I wanted to scream.  
Touching when I wanted to cry.  
Being whoever you needed  
because I didn’t think the real me  
was worth keeping around.

---

I didn’t just fear abandonment—  
I *expected* it.  
So I bent myself backwards  
trying to preempt the exit signs.

---

But real love?  
The kind I’m learning now?

It doesn’t flinch when the mask drops.  
It doesn’t walk away  
when I say the hard thing.  
It doesn’t demand an act—  
it demands *truth.*

---

I’m unlearning how to perform  
and learning how to *be.*  
I’m saying “I’m not okay”  
without trying to soften it.  
I’m saying “I love you”  
without needing to prove it.

---

And if that makes some people uncomfortable?  
So be it.

Because if love only works  
when I’m pretending—  
that’s not love.  
That’s survival.

And I’m done surviving.

---

Let the curtain fall.  
This is me now.  
Unscripted.  
Unmasked.  
Still here.  
Still worthy.
