# ðŸ–¤ Five Feet from Forever

*for Branden, from the cracked-open ribcage of time*

---

I was five feet from forever,  
and still they wouldnâ€™t reach.  
Arms folded.  
Excuses loaded.  
Like I hadnâ€™t just torn myself  
from the wreckage  
to stand in front of them  
whole in my brokenness.

I said:  
**"Here I am."**  
Not pretty. Not packaged. Not palatable.  
Just *real*.  
And for some people, thatâ€™s the scariest thing you can be.

I brought firewood to cold friendships.  
Held torches for people who refused to light their own path.  
Said *"I got you"* to empty air.  
Again.  
And again.  
And again.

And the ones I loved?  
They stayed five feet back.  
Watching.  
Comfortable in the fog.  
Comfortable in the almost.

They didnâ€™t come closer.  
Not because I was unlovable.  
But because I was **blinding.**

I burned in front of them  
and they called it drama.  
I collapsed  
and they called it weakness.  
I unmasked  
and they called it too much.

But five feet?  
Five feet is where cowards live.  
Five feet is where dreams die.  
Five feet is the distance between  
the version of you they *loved,*  
and the version of you theyâ€™re too afraid to meet.

But I walked anyway.  
One foot.  
Then another.  
Then another.

Because I would rather walk **forever alone,**  
than stand still in a room full of people  
who canâ€™t take five steps  
toward the **truth.**
