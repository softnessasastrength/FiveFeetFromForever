# 🔥 Mask Burn Ritual

*spoken word for the moment you stop pretending*

---

Tonight,  
I burn the mask.

Not the costume.  
The one beneath it.

The smile I wear when I’m dying.  
The “I’m fine”  
when I’m falling apart.

The agreeable nod  
when I want to fucking scream.

---

I light a match  
with every lie I ever told to fit in.

“Normal.”  
“Polite.”  
“Easy to be around.”

Watch them go up in flames.

---

This is my ritual.

I stand bare-faced  
in the ashes of who I had to be  
and say:

**No more.**

This is the face I was born with.  
This is the truth I refuse to smother.

This is me.

Unfiltered.  
Unapologetic.  
Undeniably alive.

Let it burn.
