# 🏹 The Applause I Never Got

*spoken word for the quiet victories, the ugly survivals, the uncelebrated*

---

Where was the applause  
when I didn’t scream?  
When I showed up  
smiling  
with a heart that had just been ripped open  
in private?

Where was the standing ovation  
for dragging myself  
out of bed  
on a day that wanted me dead?

---

They clapped when I was funny.  
They clapped when I was useful.  
But not when I survived.  
Not when I *refused to disappear.*

---

I have fought silent wars  
in fluorescent-lit bathrooms.  
Held back avalanches  
mid-meeting.  
Clawed my way back to center  
with no soundtrack  
but my own heartbeat.

And no one clapped.

---

But I did.  
I fucking clapped.

I stood up,  
alone in my room,  
and gave a round of applause  
to the version of me  
that lived through another hour  
with nothing left to give.

---

So if no one else will—  
I’ll say it now:  
You made it.  
You stayed.  
You fucking stayed.  
And that’s enough.
