# 🧠 They Said / I Remember

*spoken word for the wounds that wore masks*

---

They said:  
“You’re too sensitive.”  
I remember: *flinching at slammed doors and sharp tones before I even knew the word “trauma.”*

They said:  
“Why are you so quiet?”  
I remember: *being laughed at the last time I spoke my truth too loud.*

They said:  
“You’re such a handful.”  
I remember: *how much I carried for everyone else while no one noticed the weight.*

They said:  
“You’ve changed.”  
I remember: *clawing my way through grief, rage, and rebirth just to survive. You noticed too late.*

---

They said:  
“You’re just being dramatic.”  
I remember: *watching my parents pretend everything was fine when the walls were shaking.*

They said:  
“You’re too much for me.”  
I remember: *every time I shrunk myself to fit in rooms never meant for my size.*

They said:  
“You need help.”  
I remember: *asking for it and being punished for making noise.*

They said:  
“You’re lucky we put up with you.”  
I remember: *every second I believed them.*

---

They said a lot of things.  
I remember *all* of them.  
But now I say:  
That was *their* voice.

And this—  
this is *mine.*
