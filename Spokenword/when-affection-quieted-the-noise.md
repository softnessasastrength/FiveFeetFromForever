# 🤝 When Affection Quieted the Noise

*for the moment Anxious Brain started losing its grip*

---

It didn’t take a therapist.  
It didn’t take a pill.  
It took a hug I didn’t overthink.  
A kiss I didn’t ask permission for.  
A moment of closeness I didn’t apologize for.

---

Anxious Brain used to run the show.  
Every decision,  
every silence,  
every unsent text  
filtered through its forecast of failure.

---

But then I reached out.  
I held Briar.  
Kissed Cass.  
Let Wren hold me without a map to sex.  
And the sky didn’t fall.

---

Nobody ran.  
Nobody flinched.  
In fact—  
they leaned closer.

---

Turns out, affection doesn’t scare people away.  
*Fear* does.  
Hesitation does.  
Disconnection does.

---

So I started touching without trembling.  
Speaking without scripting.  
Being without bargaining.

---

And what happened?  
My relationships didn’t crack—  
they *cemented.*

Affection didn’t ruin everything.  
It saved me.
