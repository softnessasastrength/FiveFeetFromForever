# 🛑 Someone Finally Stayed

*spoken word for the ones who didn’t run*

---

They didn’t flinch  
when I unraveled.

Didn’t bolt  
when I confessed  
that sometimes I leave first  
just to feel like I still have control.

They didn’t take the bait  
when I picked a fight  
just to prove I was unlovable.

---

They stayed.  
Not because I was easy to love—  
but because I was worth loving anyway.

---

They didn’t fill the silence  
with noise.  
They let it breathe.  
They let *me* breathe.

---

I said:  
“You’ll leave eventually.”  
They said:  
“Then I’ll just have to prove you wrong every day.”

---

I said:  
“I’m too much.”  
They said:  
“Good. I was never looking for less.”

---

I’m still learning  
how to trust it.  
How to soften into it.  
How to believe that someone could see the sharp, broken angles of me  
and still want to build a life around them.

---

But they stayed.  
And now I’m building a version of myself  
that no longer needs the exit plan.
