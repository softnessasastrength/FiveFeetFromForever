# 🧠 Anxious Brain

*for the voice that never shuts up, even when no one’s speaking*

---

Anxious Brain isn’t loud.  
It’s *constant.*

It doesn’t scream.  
It *suggests.*  
It whispers worst-case scenarios  
in a voice that sounds just like mine.

---

Anxious Brain told me not to ask.  
Not to speak.  
Not to try.  
Said, “What if they think you’re weird?”  
“What if you ruin it?”  
“What if you’re too much?”

---

So I didn’t ask to fuck.  
Didn’t ask to hang out.  
Didn’t tell people I needed them.  
Didn’t say I was breaking.

Anxious Brain said silence was safer.  
And for a while… it was.

---

But silence grew mold.  
Silence turned me bitter.  
Silence made me lonely  
in a room full of people  
I never gave the chance to know me.

---

Anxious Brain is a liar  
who sounds like a prophet.  
And the worst part?

Sometimes it’s right.  
Sometimes it *was* too much.  
But it was also *me.*

---

And now I’m unlearning that voice.  
Now I’m speaking even when I shake.  
Now I’m saying “fuck it”  
before Anxious Brain can say “don’t.”

Because I don’t want to live my whole life  
half-alive  
in my own head.
