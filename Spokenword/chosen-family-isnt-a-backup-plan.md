# 🫂 Chosen Family Isn’t a Backup Plan

*it’s the real plan most of us never knew we needed*

---

They call it “chosen family”  
like it’s plan B.  
Like it’s the people you settle for  
because your blood relatives couldn’t get their shit together.

But I didn’t *settle* for mine.  
I *fought* for them.  
Found them in the wreckage.  
Clung to them like lifeboats  
when blood ties felt like anchors.

---

Chosen family isn’t leftovers.  
It’s the meal I made myself  
after starving on someone else’s schedule.

---

I didn’t ask to be born into  
a family that didn’t see me.  
But I *did* choose the ones who did.  
The ones who held space  
when I couldn’t hold myself together.

---

Cass. Renn. Briar.  
The people who showed up  
without needing a holiday.  
The ones who answered the phone  
when all I had were screams.

---

You know what real family is?  
It’s the people who stay  
when you’re inconvenient.

Who see your mess  
and say, “Cool. I’ve got a broom too.”

---

So don’t call it a fallback.  
Chosen family isn’t the backup plan.

It’s the one I trust.  
The one I *built.*  
The one that stayed  
when the ones who were “supposed to” didn’t.

---

If blood didn’t save me,  
then fuck it—  
I’ll bleed for the ones who did.
