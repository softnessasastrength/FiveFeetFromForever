# ðŸ’” The Love That Wrecked Me Right

*spoken word for the one who cracked me open*

---

You didnâ€™t heal me.  
You *wrecked* me.

But you wrecked me **right.**  
Like a hammer to a boarded-up window  
that finally let light in.

You didnâ€™t fix me.  
You made it impossible for me to stay broken  
the same way.

---

I loved you  
with the part of me that didnâ€™t know how to love myself.

You didnâ€™t stay.  
But the lessons did.

You showed me what I could feel.  
And what I could lose.  
And what I *deserve*.

---

So no,  
youâ€™re not my forever.  
You were just the earthquake.

But Godâ€”  
thank you for shaking me loose.
