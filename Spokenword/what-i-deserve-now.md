# ðŸŒ± What I Deserve Now

*spoken word for the reclamation of worth*

---

I deserve softness.  
Not silence.

Arms that hold,  
not hands that vanish.

---

I deserve answers,  
even if theyâ€™re hard.  
Even if they sting.  
Because closure is a form of kindness,  
and Iâ€™ve been kind for too damn long.

---

I deserve mornings that donâ€™t begin with dread.  
Laughter that doesnâ€™t feel borrowed.  
Kisses that donâ€™t taste like apologies.

---

I deserve to be seen  
without performing.  
To speak  
without shrinking.  
To take up space  
without saying sorry.

---

I deserve people who show up  
*without being begged.*

I deserve friendships that donâ€™t require a rescue mission.  
Love that doesnâ€™t feel like a test.

---

I deserve to rest.  
To *rest.*  
Not collapse.  
Not burn out.  
Justâ€¦ rest.

---

I deserve the kind of peace  
I used to give to everyone else.

And this time,  
Iâ€™m not asking.

Iâ€™m claiming it.
