# 💗 What Renn Proved

*for the proof that affection and sex are not the same thing*

---

I always suspected  
you could be affectionate  
without being sexual.  
But I never had proof  
until Renn.

---

We did all the things  
people said only couples do.  
Held hands.  
Cuddled.  
Slept in the same bed.  
Touched with care, not expectation.

And it never turned into sex.

---

People couldn’t understand.  
They called it dating.  
They called it denial.  
But what it really was  
was revolutionary.

---

There was a night in her backseat.  
We were both stoned,  
the air thick with quiet,  
and she just held me  
while I *let everything out.*

---

Not just words.  
*Wounds.*  
She ran her hand through my hair  
and didn’t flinch  
at the damage.

That was love.  
Not romantic.  
Not sexual.  
*Relational.*  
Sacred.

---

That’s when I understood.  
I wasn’t craving sex.  
I was craving *aftercare.*

The safety.  
The softness.  
The proof that my nervous system  
was allowed to come down.

---

So now I’m asking—  
Why can’t we build relationships  
that start with aftercare,  
instead of only offering it  
as a reward for sex?

Why can’t holding someone  
be the *point*,  
not the prelude?

---

Renn proved  
that it’s not crazy  
to want a friend  
who holds you so close  
you can hear their heartbeat  
and still not call it “more than friends.”

Because maybe  
*that* is friendship  
at its most evolved.
