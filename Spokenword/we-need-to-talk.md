# 🚨 We Need to Talk (But Never Really Do)

*spoken word for the neuro-spicy heart that hears sirens instead of safety*

---

“We need to talk.”  
Those four fucking words  
hit harder than any punch I ever took.

My whole body flinches  
like I just heard gunfire.  
My brain starts scrolling  
through every *possible* mistake  
I might’ve made  
in the last decade.

Because “we need to talk”  
has *never* meant  
“we need to connect.”

It means:  
**You fucked up.**  
**I’m disappointed.**  
**This is a trap.**

---

So I start rehearsing.  
Apologies I haven’t been asked for.  
Defenses I shouldn’t need.  
A thousand possible versions of *what they might be mad about.*

And by the time the actual talk happens?  
I’m not even there.  
Just a hollowed-out body  
with fight-or-flight in the driver’s seat.

---

Because growing up?  
Talks weren’t safe.  
Talks meant yelling.  
Meant tears.  
Meant guilt I didn’t earn  
and shame I couldn’t shake.

So now?  
Even in calm tones,  
even with people I love—  
those words still *sting.*

---

I wish we meant it  
when we said “we need to talk.”  
I wish we meant:

**“I need to open up.”**  
**“I’m scared, and I don’t want to be alone in it.”**  
**“Can we meet in the middle?”**

But we don’t.  
We weaponize it.  
Use it to pin people down  
instead of open them up.

---

So here’s my request:  
If we *do* need to talk—  
say what it’s *actually* about.  
Say:  
“Can I share something that hurt me?”  
Or  
“I want to tell you the truth and still be loved.”

Don’t drop a landmine.  
Drop your armor.

And maybe,  
just maybe,  
I’ll be able to hear you  
without running.
