# How to Let Go When They’re Not Coming Back

They’re gone.  
Maybe they left.  
Maybe they ghosted.  
Maybe they changed.  
Or maybe you changed, and they didn’t come with you.

And now it’s time to let go.

Here’s how to do it without losing yourself.

---

## 🪞 1. Say the Thing Out Loud

> “They’re not coming back.”

It hurts.  
It’ll make you flinch.  
But saying it breaks the trance.

Silence keeps ghosts alive.  
Truth buries them.

---

## 🪦 2. Grieve What Could’ve Been

Not just them.  
The *idea* of them.  
The version of the future that won’t exist now.

Cry over that.  
Mourn the fantasy.  
It deserves a funeral.

---

## 🫠 3. Let Yourself Obsess (But Give It Limits)

You will replay the conversations.  
You will re-read the messages.  
You will stalk the socials.

Set a timer.  
Let it happen.  
And when the timer ends, breathe.  
You survived another loop.

## 🧊 4. Don’t Chase Closure

If you get it, cool.  
If not?  
**Make your own.**

Say:
> “I deserved better communication.  
> I will give that to others.  
> That’s how I close this.”

---

## ✂️ 5. Remove the Access

Mute them.  
Unfollow.  
Block if you need to.  
You’re not being dramatic.  
You’re creating *emotional perimeter security.*

You don’t heal while bleeding on the open scroll.

---

## 🛠️ 6. Rebuild the Rituals

Did they wake you up?  
Did you always text goodnight?  
Did you watch a show together?

Reclaim those rituals.  
Make new ones.  
Plant your feet in *your* life again.

---

## 🧠 7. Speak Kindly to the Part That Misses Them

Don’t shame yourself for still wanting them.  
Talk to that ache like it’s a scared kid:
> “I know you miss them. But we’re still safe without them.”

Because you are.

---

## 💌 8. Write the Letter You’ll Never Send

Let it be messy.  
Let it be wild.  
Let it be unfair.  
Say everything.  
Then close the doc.  
And breathe.

---

Letting go doesn’t mean forgetting.  
It means *forgiving the version of you that stayed too long,*  
and choosing the version that’s still here.

You can let go now.
