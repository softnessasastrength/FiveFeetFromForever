# How to Stop Hating Yourself When You Fucked Up

You messed up.  
Maybe big.  
Maybe you lied. Hurt someone. Lost someone.  
Maybe you broke trust.  
Maybe you broke yourself.

And now your brain wants to punish you forever.  
But that‚Äôs not healing.  
That‚Äôs just **bleeding in circles.**

Here‚Äôs how to stop the spiral.

## üí£ 1. Own It Without Becoming It

You did a shitty thing.  
That doesn‚Äôt make you a shitty person.  
**Don‚Äôt let the mistake become your identity.**

Own it.  
Apologize for it.  
But don‚Äôt camp there.

You are not the worst thing you‚Äôve done.

## ü™û 2. Say It Out Loud

To someone.  
To a journal.  
To yourself in the mirror.

Shame festers in silence.  
Speaking the truth robs it of its power.  
Say:
> ‚ÄúI fucked up. But I want to be better.‚Äù

That‚Äôs how it starts.

## üß† 3. Watch the Narrative Loop

The brain loves patterns‚Äîespecially destructive ones.  
If yours is repeating ‚ÄúI‚Äôm awful, I‚Äôm trash, I ruin everything,‚Äù  
intervene.

Even if you don‚Äôt believe it yet, say:
> ‚ÄúI made a mistake. I‚Äôm learning from it.‚Äù

Repetition rewires reality.

## ‚è≥ 4. Let Time Have a Say

You‚Äôre not done yet.  
The story isn‚Äôt over.  
The person you hurt might forgive you.  
Or they might not.

But *you* still get to evolve.  
Let time change the shape of the pain.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è 5. Make Repairs, Not Excuses

A real apology looks like:
- Naming what you did
- Taking responsibility without deflecting
- Asking what repair looks like (then doing it)
- Accepting if they don‚Äôt want to hear it

But do it anyway.  
Because *you* need to hear you own it, too.

## üß∂ 6. Unlearn Perfectionism

You fucked up because you‚Äôre human.  
You‚Äôre learning.  
Growth is messy.  
If you expected yourself to be flawless,  
that was the first mistake.

Let yourself evolve in public.  
It‚Äôs okay.

---

## ü´Ä 7. Talk to Yourself Like a Friend

Would you call a friend ‚Äúa worthless piece of shit‚Äù for messing up?  
No?

Then don‚Äôt say it to yourself.

Practice:
> ‚ÄúThat version of me made a bad call.  
> This version is trying.‚Äù

---

You can stop hating yourself.  
Not because what you did was okay.  
But because who you are now  
**is not who you were then.**
