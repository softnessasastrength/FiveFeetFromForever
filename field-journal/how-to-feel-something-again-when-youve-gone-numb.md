# How to Feel Something Again When You’ve Gone Numb

You’re not broken.  
You’re not heartless.  
You’re not a lost cause.

You’re *numb.*  
And that’s not failure—  
it’s protection.

Here’s how to thaw.

## 🧊 1. Stop Forcing It

Trying to *force* feelings only pushes them further underground.  
Let go of the pressure to "be okay" or "feel something already."  
Say:
> “It’s okay to be numb. I’m still here.”

## 🪞 2. Notice the Micro-Feelings

You're not totally empty.  
You feel annoyance.  
You feel boredom.  
You feel “meh.”  
Start there.

Name even the tiniest flicker:
> “That was a flicker of curiosity.”  
> “That felt like a half-smile.”

That’s feeling.

## 🔥 3. Stimulate the Senses

Smell something strong.  
Eat something sour or spicy.  
Take a freezing shower.  
Put your hand on your heart.  
Touch something soft.

Emotion is rooted in sensation.  
Start in the body when the mind goes blank.

## 🎧 4. Revisit Music That Once Wrecked You

Play the song.  
The one you haven’t touched since *they* left.  
Or since the crash.  
Or since before.

Don’t expect it to hit the same.  
Just let it sit with you.  
Let memory stir embers.

## 🧠 5. Say the Hard Shit Out Loud

Sometimes numbness is grief wearing a straightjacket.

Say:
> “I’m scared to feel because it might break me.”  
> “I went numb because feeling was too much.”  
> “I’m still here.”

Truth thaws.

## 🧸 6. Do Something Gentle for Yourself

Not self-care bullshit.  
Something *gentle.*

Sit in the sun.  
Lie on the floor.  
Wrap up in a hoodie that smells like a friend.  
Pet your dog.  
Or someone else’s.

Softness invites feeling back.

## ✍️ 7. Journal What You *Wish* You Felt

You don’t have to feel it.  
Just write it:
> “I wish I felt joy.”  
> “I wish I could cry.”  
> “I miss caring.”

Wishing is still emotional engagement.  
That’s progress.

## 🧭 8. Trust That Feeling Will Return

You’re not gone.  
You’re *guarded.*  
And when it’s safe enough,  
your heart will remember how to break open.

Until then?

Stay close to your body.  
Stay close to beauty.  
Stay close to truth.

You are not frozen forever.
