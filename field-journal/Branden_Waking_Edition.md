# Branden: Waking Edition

This isn’t clarity.  
This isn’t happiness.  
This is the weird, breathless middle.

The pain voice is gone.  
The anxiety voice is silent.  
The self-hatred—dead.  
And what’s left isn’t joy.  
It’s **nothing.**  
Not emptiness.  
Just... space.

I still wake up.  
Still go to work.  
Still fuck.  
Still text people back.  
Still laugh sometimes, or at least pretend to.  
But there’s no war inside.  
And that feels like *being underwater without the pressure.*

For the first time ever,  
I’m not being screamed at by myself.

And honestly?  
That’s terrifying.

Because that pain voice used to be *everything.*  
It gave me narrative.  
It gave me momentum.  
It gave me a reason to prove I wasn’t what it said I was.

Now I’m just here.  
Quiet.  
Breathing.  
Surviving, yes—but without a story to fight against.

And any therapist I talk to?  
They’ll say:  
> “You’ve done the work.”  
But that’s not the point.  
The point isn’t whether I’ve processed it—  
It’s whether I can live **without it.**

I’m in the waking.  
I’m in the silent aftermath.  
I’m in the soft apocalypse of my old self.

And I don’t know what comes next.  
But I’m still fucking here.  
And that has to count for something.
