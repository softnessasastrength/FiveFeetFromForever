# I Should Be Dead, And I’m Not

I should be dead.

Let’s just start there.  
Let’s not sugarcoat it.  
Let’s not sanitize it.

I should be dead.  
And I’m not.

And that fact?  
That reality?  
That **miracle disguised as a mundane sentence**  
is the whole fucking point.

I tried.  
I really fucking tried.  
No plan, no note—just raw, unfiltered *done.*  
100 miles per hour toward the back of a semi,  
and five feet from forever...  
I swerved.

Not because I believed in life.  
But because something—  
some flicker of not-yet  
some sliver of **“maybe”**  
cut through the noise.

And now I’m here.  
Not okay.  
Not healed.  
But here.

And people want me to care.  
To give a fuck about taxes, jobs, dishes, deadlines.  
My mom wants me evaluated, medicated, *handled.*  
But what she doesn’t get is—  
**I already did the evaluation.**  
It was called *life.*  
And it almost fucking ended.

But I didn’t let it.

I fought a silent war for years.  
Years of numbness.  
Years of fake smiles.  
Years of “I’m fine” on loop like a broken fucking prayer.

And I almost lost.  
I almost lost.  
But I didn’t.

And now?

No, I’m not going to try again.  
Not unless I’m terminally ill,  
and even then, I’d probably write a poem first.

I want this to be clear for the edgy teens,  
the numb kids,  
the ones who scream into pillows and smile in group chats—

**You are not alone.**

I don’t say that to be corny.  
I say it because I *am* you.  
And I made it five feet further.

You don’t need a reason.  
You just need a minute.  
A pause.  
A breath.  
A shoulder.  
A voice—  
even if it’s your own.

This is mine.

I should be dead.  
And I’m not.  
And I’m going to scream that until someone else puts down the wheel  
and swerves too.
