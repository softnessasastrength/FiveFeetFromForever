# The Five Feet From Forever Manifesto

I didn’t die.  
I deconstructed.  
And what rose from the crash wasn’t clarity—it was **presence.**

This is not a podcast.  
This is a protest against erasure.  
This is a survival system for people who stayed.

---

## We Believe:

- That survival is not shameful—it is sacred.
- That numbness is not weakness—it is the moment before thawing.
- That silence can be a sign of safety, not absence.
- That you don’t have to justify your existence to anyone.
- That no one should have to perform their pain to be believed.
- That emotional honesty is revolutionary.
- That presence—real, raw, unarmored presence—is power.

## We Are:

The ones who almost didn’t make it.  
The ones who got five feet from forever and said *“Not today.”*  
The ones who stayed, cried, wrote it down, and decided to live it out loud.

---

## We Reject:

- Shame as a survival tool.  
- Polished, packaged healing.  
- Systems that punish vulnerability.  
- The lie that silence equals strength.  
- The expectation that we go back to “normal.”

---

## We Commit:

- To speaking our truth without shrinking.
- To witnessing without fixing.
- To staying—on hard days, blank days, rebirth days.
- To building new systems. New rituals. New languages for pain and hope.
- To telling our stories even if our voices shake.

## If You’re Reading This…

You’re still here.  
That is enough.

You don’t have to make sense yet.  
You just have to make space.

This isn’t the end of the story.  
It’s five feet from it.

And we’re still fucking here.
