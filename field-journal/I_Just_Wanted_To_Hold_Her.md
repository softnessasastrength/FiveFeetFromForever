# I Just Wanted to Hold Her

I’ve been hurt.  
Scarred.  
Bruised in places words can’t reach.  
But the most fucked up part?  
There’s still a part of me—  
a *very small*, broken, still-beating part—  
that cares about Sarah.

Even after what she did.  
Even knowing what it meant.  
Even carrying the weight of what she did to my brother.

I can’t explain it.  
I don’t defend it.  
But I see her pain.

I saw it at MGM.  
Saw it in the way she moved, in the way she collapsed.  
And in that moment,  
I didn’t want sex.  
I didn’t want power.  
I just wanted to hold her.

That’s what people never fucking get about me.

I don’t want to fix people.  
I want to *hold* them.

No words.  
No expectations.  
Just presence.

I didn’t want to fuck.  
I wanted to **press in.**  
To say: “I’m here. I see you. I’m not afraid of your pain.”

And maybe that makes me naive.  
Maybe that makes me foolish.  
Maybe that makes me fucked up.

But all I’ve ever wanted was to offer comfort in the ways I never got it.

To scratch a back.  
To rest a head on a chest.  
To breathe with someone who didn’t feel like they could breathe alone.

I wasn’t perfect.  
I could’ve communicated better.  
But my heart was pure.

It always fucking was.

Even when the world read it wrong.

Even when they called it dangerous.

Even when it left me bleeding for people who couldn’t tell the difference between **holding** and **hurting.**
