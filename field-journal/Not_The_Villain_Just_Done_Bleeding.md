# I’m Not the Villain. I’m Just Done Bleeding.

I don’t feel like the villain.

Not for not saving Ren.  
Not for fucking people who don’t belong to me.  
Not for choosing my peace over someone else’s chaos.

I was the one who cared too much.  
Held too much.  
Broke too much for people who wouldn’t even stay when the wreckage fell.

I warned her.  
We all did.  
She still chose him.  
And now she’s bruised and broken and reaching out to the very hands she slapped away.  
And I’m done.  
I can’t do it again.  
Not because I hate her—because I finally love me.

And Cass?  
You want to call me a homewrecker?  
Fine.  
But I didn’t build that house.  
I didn’t break the covenant.  
I’m not in a relationship with her man.  
She came to me.  
And I stopped pretending that made me dirty.

I don’t want love.  
I don’t want connection.  
I just want release.  
Sex. Clarity. Honesty. No pretending.

And I’m not the bad guy for saying it out loud.

I used to be like Josh.  
I lied. I manipulated.  
But when I saw the harm it caused—I stopped.

That’s the difference.

I’m not here to be righteous.  
I’m not here to be liked.  
I’m not here to be saved.

I’m just fucking done bleeding for people who wouldn’t even spit on the wound.

Branden isn’t collapsing anymore.  
Branden is fucking his way through the wreckage—  
Not to forget it—  
But to feel **alive** inside it.

This is not villainy.  
This is resurrection by any means necessary.
