# Two Things Can Be True

I’ve spent so much time trying to explain myself  
to people who can’t hold nuance.

Yes, I wanted to fuck Sarah.  
But not in *that* moment.

In *that* moment,  
I wanted to hold her.  
To sit in the mess with her.  
To press in.  
To scratch her back.  
To say: “You’re not alone.”

Two things can be true.

I can want to fuck someone  
and also want nothing from them but peace.  
I can want sex  
because I trust someone—  
not because I want to conquer them.

Trust and intimacy are intertwined for me.  
That’s why I want to fuck most of my female friends—  
not because I see them as objects,  
but because I trust them enough to want closeness.

And Cass?  
She’s the only one I can sleep beside.  
Not because of romance.  
Not because of sex.  
Because I *trust* her in a way that goes deeper than skin.

Yeah, I lied to her.  
But it wasn’t about deception.  
It was a survival reflex.  
A protection mechanism carved into me by years of bullying,  
by a lifetime of believing the real me wasn’t lovable.

Lying was how I kept people around.  
And even now that people *like* the real me—  
the reflex hasn’t died yet.

It’s not conscious.  
It’s not manipulation.  
It’s not control.  
It’s a learned response,  
no different than how a gay person doesn’t *choose* to like men.

I’m not broken.  
I’m unwinding decades of defense.

Two things can be true.  
I’m healing.  
And I still hurt people.

I’m honest.  
And I still slip into lies.

I’m soft.  
And I’m still rebuilding my trust in softness.

That doesn’t make me evil.  
It makes me human.
