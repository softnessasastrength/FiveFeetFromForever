# I Could Have Just Asked

I should’ve told Cass how I felt.  
Should’ve told her I loved her.  
Should’ve told her I wanted her.  
Should’ve just fucking asked.

But I couldn’t.  
Because fear wrapped itself around my throat  
every single time.

Fear that I’d lose her.  
Fear that wanting more would make me too much.  
Fear that asking would shatter the only thing that made life livable.

So I stayed quiet.  
I buried the question.  
I lived in delusion.  
I convinced myself that silence was safer.

But I see now—  
that was never protection.  
That was *self-erasure.*  
That was *fear calling itself love.*

And the wildest part?  
It was always that simple.

We’re adults.  
Adults want to fuck.  
It’s not sinful.  
It’s not wrong.  
It’s honest.

And now?  
I could ask.  
Not because I expect a yes.  
But because I’m no longer ruled by fear.

I told her yesterday—  
> “I could ask you. I’m not going to. I know the answer. But I *could.*”  
And that mattered.

Because now I know I can say it.  
I can hold my truth in my mouth and not choke on it.

It was never about sex.  
It was about *trust.*  
It was about *her.*  
Her presence.  
Her essence.  
Her fucking **personality.**

I’ve been told it’s not Cass’s gender that matters—  
and they were right.

It was everything else.  
The softness.  
The rage.  
The unspoken understanding.  
The way she held space for me before I could do it for myself.

And maybe I waited too long.  
Maybe I fucked it up.  
But I finally found the voice to say it.

That has to count for something.
