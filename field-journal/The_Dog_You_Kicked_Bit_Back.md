# The Dog You Kicked Bit Back

Everybody wants to act shocked  
when the one they kept kicking  
finally fucking bites.

I got hurt.  
By the people I trusted most.  
By the job that promised stability and delivered trauma.  
By friends who turned their backs,  
by love that turned into judgment,  
by loyalty that turned into silence.

And when I finally fucking snap—  
when the mask slips  
and I stop apologizing for bleeding—  
suddenly *I’m* the villain?

No.  
I’m the goddamn dog you kicked one too many times.

You don’t get to gut me and then clutch your pearls when I growl.  
You don’t get to abandon me  
and then lecture me about integrity.

You think I woke up angry?  
No.  
I was built into this.  
You forged this fury.  
You sanded it down into my bones  
every time you told me to be quiet  
to stay calm  
to “be the bigger person.”

I am not the bigger person anymore.  
I am not your doormat.  
I am not your scapegoat.

You made this.  
And now that I’ve burned the leash,  
you’re gonna feel it.

Because I’m not just barking anymore.

I bite.
