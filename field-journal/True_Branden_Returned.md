# True Branden Returned

I’ve done desperate things.  
I’ve made mistakes.  
I’ve fucked up out of pain and panic—  
but I’ve *never* betrayed a friendship for my own feelings.

That’s the line I don’t cross.

Because I value people.  
I value presence.  
I value the ones who stayed when the world didn’t.

And I don’t understand this fucked-up game  
where people put romantic partners above their friends—  
burning bridges just to hold someone who probably won’t stay.

Because guess what?

**90% of relationships end.**  
But your friends?  
Your real ones?  
They’re the ones picking up the pieces.

So why the fuck do we abandon them the moment a warm body comes along?

I don’t get it.  
I never have.  
Because I know what loyalty costs.  
I know how sacred trust is.

And now—  
finally—  
I can say it.

I can *communicate.*

All it took was one dark night.  
One hard crash.  
One raw, raging conversation with Jesse.  
And something cracked open.

Now I can say anything.  
To anyone.  
At any time.

I am *True Branden.*  
The unfiltered.  
The unarmored.  
The version of me that doesn’t fucking flinch.

I feel almost nothing—  
except during sex.  
And even that’s just presence trying to force its way in.  
But it’s not suicidal anymore.  
And that’s something.

That’s everything.

I’m alive.  
Still fucked up, still healing, still numb—  
but **communicating.**

And that’s the first time in a long time  
I can say that with pride.

True Branden is back.

Unapologetic.  
Unedited.  
Unfuckwithable.
