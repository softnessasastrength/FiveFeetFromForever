# Don’t Talk to Me Like You Understand

You want to talk to me *now?*  
Now that I’ve bled all over the floor?  
Now that I’ve scraped myself back from the edge?

Matt fucking Jones wants to *chat?*

The same man who belittled me.  
Dismissed me.  
Made me feel like feeling was weakness.  
Wants to drop some fatherly wisdom?

Miss me with that shit.

Because unless you’ve been  
five fucking feet from forever,  
unless you’ve stared down the back of a semi at 100 miles an hour  
and decided in a fraction of a second that your life might still matter—  
you don’t get to say a goddamn thing.

You don’t get to call me a fuck-up  
when the system failed me  
and I did what I had to do to survive.  
I lied.  
I coped.  
I masked.  
I broke.  
And I’m still here.

Not because of help.  
But in spite of it.

It took breaking to finally get someone to listen.  
It took almost dying to start healing.  
It took more pain than I can ever explain  
to finally speak without fear of being shamed for it.

So no—  
I don’t want your sermon.  
I don’t want your advice.  
I don’t want your late-game guilt trip.

Unless you’ve lived what I’ve lived  
felt what I’ve felt  
screamed what I’ve screamed in the dark  
you don’t get to lecture me about how I came back from it.

This is MY fucking recovery.

You weren’t there for the crash.  
You don’t get to narrate the comeback.
