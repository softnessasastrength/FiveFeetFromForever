# Emotional Communism Was the Answer All Along

Human touch.

That’s all it fucking would’ve taken.  
Not a sermon.  
Not a diagnosis.  
Not a goddamn institutionalization.

Just someone to hold me.  
To scratch my back.  
To press in.  
To say nothing.  
To just be there.

That’s it.

It could’ve saved me.  
It could’ve thawed me.  
It could’ve rewired me before I ever hit the gas pedal.

And now I see it.  
**Everything ties back to Emotional Communism.**

Not the ideology they warned you about.  
Not politics.  
Not power.

But the radical idea  
that we *deserve to be held.*  
That affection isn’t transactional.  
That presence is a right, not a reward.

It’s not even revolutionary.  
It’s primal.  
It’s ancient.  
It’s **human.**

And we’re starving for it.

We’ve built entire systems to avoid vulnerability—  
to protect ourselves from the very thing that could heal us.

And I’m done with that.

I’m done pretending that pain needs punishment.  
That trauma needs medication before it needs **a hug.**  
That we don’t need each other in the most tactile, primal ways.

Emotional Communism was the answer all along.  
Give love.  
Hold people.  
Let them hold you.  
No charge.  
No shame.  
No catch.

Just shared humanity,  
five feet from forever.
