# Five Feet From Forever

This is not a podcast.  
This is not a book.  
This is not a brand.

This is an archive of a resurrection.

A living GitHub repository documenting what it means to survive suicidal ideation, emotional numbness, and systemic failure—and build something honest in its place.

This repo is:
- A field journal of healing
- A manifesto of Emotional Communism
- A toolkit for staying alive and staying soft
- A spoken-word performance archive
- A fuck-you to systems that tried to institutionalize pain instead of listening to it

Everything here is free, open-source, and yours to build on.

We’re five feet from forever.  
And we’re still fucking here.
